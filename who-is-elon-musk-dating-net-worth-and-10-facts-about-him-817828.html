And yes, we’ll also answer the burning question: who is&nbsp;Elon Musk dating?</p><p>Elon Musk has had several high-profile relationships over the years. He&nbsp;first married <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Justine Musk</a> in&nbsp;2000, and they had six children together before divorcing in&nbsp;2008. Musk then married English actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Talulah Riley</a> in&nbsp;2010, but they later divorced and remarried before finalizing their second divorce in&nbsp;2016.</p><p>He&nbsp;has also been linked to&nbsp;actress Amber Heard and singer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Grimes</a>, with whom he&nbsp;has two children. In&nbsp;November 2021, Elon Musk fathered twins with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis, just weeks before his second child with Grimes was born.</p><p>Musk now has ten children, and jokingly suggested that his growing brood could solve the ’<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>underpopulation crisis</a>.’ In&nbsp;2022, he&nbsp;tweeted, «Doing my&nbsp;best to&nbsp;help the underpopulation crisis. A&nbsp;collapsing birth rate is&nbsp;the biggest danger civilization faces by&nbsp;far.» So, who is&nbsp;Elon Musk dating amidst this whirlwind of&nbsp;personal affairs?</p><p><h2>Jennifer Gwynne</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/845/391/ecc2b35575af60b9976aa686c8.jpg><p>During the mid-1990s, Musk met Jennifer Gwynne while they were both students at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Pennsylvania. Gwynne later told <i>PEOPLE</i> that she was attracted to&nbsp;Musk’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>quiet intensity</a>. However, he&nbsp;occasionally showed a&nbsp;silly side. The couple dated for about a&nbsp;year, during which time they were serious enough to&nbsp;introduce each other to&nbsp;their <a href=# title=families data-link=tag>families</a>. For her birthday, Musk even gave Gwynne a&nbsp;gold and emerald necklace.</p><p>Shortly after Gwynne returned from studying abroad, she and Musk ended their relationship. Gwynne explained that Musk struggled with long-distance relationships and found phone conversations to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;waste of&nbsp;time.</p><p>In&nbsp;2022, Gwynne auctioned off items from their time together, including several photos and a&nbsp;handwritten card, to&nbsp;help pay for her stepson’s <a href=# title=college data-link=tag>college</a> tuition.</p><p>She fondly recalled her time dating Musk as&nbsp;amazing, noting his brilliance and vision were balanced with a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;wide-eyed wonder back then, «I&nbsp;can tell stories of&nbsp;Elon predicting the future of&nbsp;electric cars. I&nbsp;remember spending the holidays in&nbsp;1994 with Elon’s family in&nbsp;their Toronto home. Elon, Kimbal, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tosca</a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Maye Musk</a> are a&nbsp;close-knit family, but for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days that winter, they welcomed me&nbsp;into their tribe.»</p><p><h2>Justine Musk<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/91a/efa/f4ae0e5a55b422ecce0dbec711.png><p>It&nbsp;seems like everyone’s wondering: who is&nbsp;Elon Musk dating these days? Musk first met <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Justine Musk</a> (née Wilson) when they were both students at&nbsp;Queen’s University in&nbsp;Ontario, <a href=# title=Canada data-link=tag>Canada</a>. At&nbsp;the time, Justine was a&nbsp;first-year student and Musk was a&nbsp;second-year student. He&nbsp;approached her after spotting her across the common room.</p><p>«He&nbsp;invited me&nbsp;out for ice cream. I&nbsp;said yes, but then blew him off with a&nbsp;note on&nbsp;my&nbsp;dorm-room door,» she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;2010 Marie Claire essay. «Several hours later, my&nbsp;head bent over my&nbsp;Spanish text in&nbsp;an&nbsp;overheated room in&nbsp;the student center, I&nbsp;heard a&nbsp;polite cough behind&nbsp;me. Musk was smiling awkwardly, two chocolate-chip ice cream cones dripping down his hands. He’s not a&nbsp;man who takes no&nbsp;for an&nbsp;answer.»</p><p>Although Musk later transferred schools, he&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;pursue Justine. But they broke up&nbsp;before Justine moved to&nbsp;Japan for a&nbsp;year to&nbsp;teach English as&nbsp;a&nbsp;second language. A&nbsp;week after she returned to&nbsp;Canada, he&nbsp;called her by&nbsp;chance. Justine moved to&nbsp;California to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with Musk, and they soon became engaged. They tied the knot in&nbsp;2000.</p><p>Looking back on&nbsp;their relationship, Justine wrote that there were early «warning signs» about their future, including Musk’s comments about being an&nbsp;«alpha.»</p><p>She claimed: «In&nbsp;the months following our wedding, a&nbsp;certain dynamic began to&nbsp;take hold. Musk’s judgment was overriding mine, and he&nbsp;was constantly commenting on&nbsp;the ways in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;found me&nbsp;lacking. ’I&nbsp;am your wife,’ I&nbsp;told him repeatedly, ’not your employee.’ If&nbsp;you were my&nbsp;employee,» he&nbsp;said just as&nbsp;often, «I&nbsp;would fire you. »</p><p>In&nbsp;2002, the couple welcomed their first child, Nevada Alexander, who died of&nbsp;sudden <a href=# title=infant data-link=tag>infant</a> death syndrome at&nbsp;just 10&nbsp;weeks old. In&nbsp;her essay, Justine shared that the couple grieved in&nbsp;very different ways, but decided to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;get pregnant again as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible. They later welcomed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>twins</a> Griffin and Vivian in&nbsp;2004 and a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;triplets&nbsp;— Kai, Saxon and Damian&nbsp;— in&nbsp;2006.</p><p>Justine recalled that they had a&nbsp;«dream lifestyle» filled with extravagant events, multimillion-dollar homes and a&nbsp;staff that catered to&nbsp;their every need. But she felt a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;«intimacy and <a href=# title=empathy data-link=tag>empathy</a>» from Musk.</p><p>She wrote that a&nbsp;car accident served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;«wake-up call» for her. «I&nbsp;barely recognized myself,» she said. «I&nbsp;had turned into a&nbsp;trophy wife.» Shortly after the accident, the couple tried counseling, but after only a&nbsp;month, Musk allegedly gave her an&nbsp;ultimatum: live as&nbsp;they had or&nbsp;get a&nbsp;divorce. He&nbsp;filed for divorce the next day.</p><p>Following their split in&nbsp;2008, the couple went through a&nbsp;complicated divorce that ended with them sharing custody of&nbsp;their five children. Justine also received the couple’s <a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a> home and spousal and child support from Musk, he&nbsp;wrote for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Business Insider</i></a> in&nbsp;2010.</p><p><h2>Talulah Riley<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7dc/1c0/dacebe54aca1faa7dca0a282cf.jpg><p>Evan Agostini / Invision / AP / East News</p><p>Musk met actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Talulah Riley</a> shortly after he&nbsp;filed for divorce from Justine. According to&nbsp;Business Insider, the two first met at&nbsp;a&nbsp;bar in&nbsp;London. Riley later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a> that she didn’t know who he&nbsp;was at&nbsp;the time.</p><p>«I&nbsp;remember thinking that this guy probably didn’t get to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;young actresses a&nbsp;lot and that he&nbsp;seemed quite nervous,» she told biographer Ashlee Vance. «I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;be&nbsp;really nice to&nbsp;him and give him a&nbsp;nice evening. Little did&nbsp;I know that he’d spoken to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;pretty girls in&nbsp;his life.»</p><p>Just <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>six weeks</a> after Musk’s divorce filing from Justine, he&nbsp;and Riley were engaged. They tied the knot at&nbsp;Dornoch Cathedral in&nbsp;Scotland in&nbsp;2010. Musk filed for divorce just <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>two years</a> later.</p><p>«It’s been an&nbsp;amazing four years. I&nbsp;will <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> you forever. You will make someone very happy someday,» he&nbsp;tweeted.</p><p>But their relationship didn’t end there&nbsp;— in&nbsp;July 2013, Musk and Riley tied the knot for a&nbsp;second time.</p><p>Musk filed for divorce again in&nbsp;2014, but withdrew the petition seven months later. In&nbsp;March 2016, Riley filed for divorce, which was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>finalized in&nbsp;November</a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;2022, Riley told <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Independent</i></a> that she knew it&nbsp;was «strange» to&nbsp;marry and divorce Musk twice. Despite the split, she added that they remained friendly.</p><p>She told the outlet: «I&nbsp;suppose the reason to&nbsp;get remarried was just because it&nbsp;felt silly to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together unmarried after having been married. You know, it’s like a&nbsp;habit. We&nbsp;were saying, ’This is&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband,’ ’This is&nbsp;my&nbsp;wife,’ ’Oh, wait, no, we’re not that anymore. We&nbsp;better be&nbsp;that again.’»</p><p><h2>Amber Heard</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9fd/5f0/d2cc4e505a86319d425742cd0b.jpg><p>NO CREDIT / East News<span>, </span>NO CREDIT / East News</p><p>While Musk and Riley were separated in&nbsp;2012, he&nbsp;reached out to&nbsp;director Robert Rodriguez. He&nbsp;asked Rodriguez to&nbsp;set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;dinner with actress Amber Heard. (Musk and Heard both starred in&nbsp;Rodriguez’s film Machete Kills.)</p><p>The two <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>arranged a&nbsp;dinner</a>. But Heard, who was dating <a href=# title="Johnny Depp" data-link=tag>Johnny Depp</a> at&nbsp;the time, failed to&nbsp;show&nbsp;up. It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;several years before they began dating. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;unclear when exactly their relationship became romantic. While Depp claimed in&nbsp;court papers in&nbsp;his 2022 defamation lawsuit against Heard that Musk and Heard began <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>secretly</a> dating in&nbsp;2015, Heard said in&nbsp;court that she didn’t know Musk until the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2016 Met Gala</a>, after Depp «stood [her] up» on&nbsp;the red carpet.</p><p>«I&nbsp;didn’t recognize [Musk] until we&nbsp;started talking, and he&nbsp;reminded me&nbsp;we&nbsp;had met once before,» Heard recalled during the trial. «He&nbsp;seemed like a&nbsp;real gentleman. He&nbsp;was really nice. He&nbsp;sat at&nbsp;a&nbsp;nearby table, and we&nbsp;got to&nbsp;speaking that night and eventually became friends.»</p><p>Heard filed for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>divorce</a> from Depp just weeks later. In&nbsp;July 2016, she and Musk began sparking romance <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rumors</a>.</p><p>During a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;Australia in&nbsp;April 2017, they made things <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>official on&nbsp;Instagram</a>. By&nbsp;May, insiders said the couple was «<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>very serious</a>» about each other. Heard had already met Musk’s children.</p><p>But the couple called it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>quits</a> in&nbsp;August 2017. Their busy schedules were to&nbsp;blame for the split, which was reportedly initiated by&nbsp;Musk. Musk wrote that things ended amicably, leaving a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comment</a> on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Heard’s <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> posts.</p><p>«Although Amber and&nbsp;I did break&nbsp;up, we&nbsp;are still friends, remain close and love one another,» he&nbsp;shared. «Long distance relationships, when both partners have intense work obligations, are always difficult, but who knows what the future holds.»</p><p>Shortly after, the couple was spotted together again and released a&nbsp;joint statement to&nbsp;clear the air. The couple wrote that the distance has been hard on&nbsp;their relationship, but they still have the «utmost respect» for each other.</p><p>In&nbsp;November 2017, Musk opened up&nbsp;about their breakup in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, sharing that he&nbsp;had been «really in&nbsp;love» with her and that it&nbsp;had «hurt a&nbsp;lot» when they went their separate ways.</p><p>The following month, Musk was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>back on&nbsp;the scene</a> with Heard. Sources said they were «just friends,» though they were photographed kissing. By&nbsp;January, it&nbsp;appeared that their relationship had taken a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>romantic turn</a>, as&nbsp;Musk and Heard were spotted vacationing together in&nbsp;Chile days later.</p><p>In&nbsp;February 2018, the couple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>broke up</a>&nbsp;for the second time. A&nbsp;source revealed that the «timing wasn’t right» for the couple. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview later that year, Heard had positive things to&nbsp;say about Musk, sharing that they had bonded over their «intellectual curiosity, over ideas and conversation, over a&nbsp;shared love of&nbsp;science.»</p><p>«Elon and&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>beautiful relationship</a>, and now we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;beautiful friendship based on&nbsp;our core values,» he&nbsp;said.</p><p>The Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder reflected on&nbsp;his years-long on-and-off romance with the<i> Aquaman</i> actress in&nbsp;Walter Isaacson’s new biography of&nbsp;the same name. As&nbsp;for how Elon summed up&nbsp;their romance, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, «It&nbsp;was brutal.»</p><p><h2>Grimes</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;April 2018, after sharing a&nbsp;flirty interaction on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Twitter data-link=tag>Twitter</a>, Musk sparked <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dating rumors</a> with <a href=# title=musician data-link=tag>musician</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Grimes</a> (real name Claire Boucher). Days later, the couple made their red carpet debut at&nbsp;the Met Gala.</p><p>«They’ve been seeing each other but have been keeping their relationship under the radar,» a&nbsp;source revealed.</p><p>In&nbsp;August 2018, the couple reportedly unfollowed each other on&nbsp;social media. This led to&nbsp;speculation that they had broken&nbsp;up. Despite the breakup rumors, Musk and Grimes were spotted at&nbsp;a&nbsp;pumpkin patch in&nbsp;L.A. with his children in&nbsp;October. In&nbsp;December 2019, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> included the couple in&nbsp;a&nbsp;group photo from the Kardashian-Jenner family’s Christmas party.</p><p>In&nbsp;January 2020, Grimes <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> her pregnancy. She confirmed that Musk was the baby’s father.</p><p>«It’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sacrificing your body</a> and your freedom. It’s a&nbsp;pretty crazy sacrifice, and only half the population has to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it,» she said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p><p>In&nbsp;May, Musk and Grimes welcomed their first baby together, a&nbsp;son named <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>X&nbsp;Æ A-12</a>, or&nbsp;X for short. Musk shared that Grimes had taken on&nbsp;most of&nbsp;the parenting duties for the first few months, but he&nbsp;looked forward to&nbsp;being more involved when&nbsp;X was older.</p><p>The couple made a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>joint appearance</a> on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live in&nbsp;May 2021. By&nbsp;September, they were «<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>semi-separated</a>» but still friendly.</p><p>«It’s mostly that my&nbsp;work at&nbsp;SpaceX and Tesla requires me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;primarily in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Texas data-link=tag>Texas</a> or&nbsp;traveling overseas, and her work is&nbsp;primarily in&nbsp;L.A.,» he&nbsp;explained to&nbsp;the <i>New York Post’s Page Six.</i> «She’s staying with me&nbsp;now, and Baby X&nbsp;is in&nbsp;the adjacent room.»</p><p>Despite their separation, the couple welcomed their second baby via surrogate in&nbsp;December. Grimes confirmed the birth in&nbsp;a&nbsp;March 2022 interview with Vanity Fair, sharing that they welcomed a&nbsp;baby girl <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>named</a> Exa «Y» Dark Sideræl. She also shared that she and Musk were back together.</p><p>«There’s no&nbsp;real word for&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;would probably refer to&nbsp;him as&nbsp;my&nbsp;boyfriend, but we’re very fluid,» she shared. «We&nbsp;live in&nbsp;separate houses. We’re best friends. We&nbsp;see each other all the time. ... We&nbsp;just have our own thing going&nbsp;on, and&nbsp;I don’t expect other people to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;it.»</p><p>But on&nbsp;the same day <i>Vanity Fair</i> published the story, Grimes shared that the couple’s relationship status had changed since the interview.</p><p>«Me&nbsp;and&nbsp;E broke up&nbsp;*again* since this article was written,» she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tweeted</a>. «But he’s my&nbsp;best friend and the love of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, and my&nbsp;life and art are forever dedicated to&nbsp;The Mission now, I&nbsp;think Devin [Gordon of&nbsp;<i>Vanity Fair</i>] wrote that part of&nbsp;the story rly well. Sique&nbsp;— peace out.»</p><p><h2>Shivon Zilis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e48/e95/6e99f552ff8d29da861464483e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;July 2022, Insider reported that Musk had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fathered twins</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Strider and Azure</a>, with Shivon Zilis, an&nbsp;executive at&nbsp;his company Neuralink, in&nbsp;November 2021.
