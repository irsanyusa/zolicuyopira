But the years beat the time, and believe it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, it&nbsp;has been almost two decades since one of&nbsp;the greatest medical hits came to&nbsp;the screen.</p><p>For many fans, <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> cast was the initial spark and first love for medicine. Let’s see which actors defined this wonderful era and where they are today. <strong>Warning, the article has spoilers!</strong></p><p><h2>1. Meredith Grey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/342/71a/6fe45b5f4bb22c2616810ffb9e.jpg><p><strong>Meredith Grey</strong>, who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>began</a> her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> as&nbsp;an&nbsp;intern at&nbsp;Seattle Grace Hospital and ended up&nbsp;being Chief of&nbsp;General Surgery, was the primary character in&nbsp;this story. Her life has been a&nbsp;roller coaster, with friends and afterward, her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>husband</a> dying, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surviving</a> a&nbsp;plane collapse, even facing being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dismissed</a> for insurance fraud, and performing community service before returning to&nbsp;work.</p><p>Ellen Pompeo, the delightful actress who displayed Meredith on&nbsp;the screens, considered <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>departing</a> in&nbsp;2018 to&nbsp;spend more time with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>three</a> children. She poured her heart and all of&nbsp;herself into the show, giving it&nbsp;everything she had, and she hinted at&nbsp;sticking around longer due to&nbsp;the series’ impact and popularity. Later in&nbsp;Season&nbsp;19, she played a&nbsp;less significant role, appearing in&nbsp;just eight episodes as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>choice</a> to&nbsp;leave Seattle and go&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Boston</a> with her children.</p><p>Despite this, she continued to&nbsp;tell the majority of&nbsp;the narrative. Aside from Grey’s Anatomy, Pompeo will appear in&nbsp;and produce a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>new</a> Hulu series with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>similarities</a> to&nbsp;the 2009 film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Orphan</i></a>. She has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> to&nbsp;Chris Ivery since 2007, and the couple has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>three</a> children: Stella Luna, 14, Sienna May, 9, and Eli Christopher, 6.</p><p><h2>2. Miranda Bailey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c11/567/ea7a0957028a10de21b028617e.jpg><p><strong>Miranda Bailey</strong>, portrayed by&nbsp;Chandra Wilson, was first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>introduced</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;strict person in&nbsp;the series in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;highlight her no-nonsense personality. Behind her gruff face, she cared deeply about her interns and worked tirelessly to&nbsp;help them succeed. She still won’t put up&nbsp;with foolishness as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Chief of&nbsp;Surgery</a>. Miranda became one of&nbsp;the more steady characters throughout the show despite her challenges.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dismissed</a> Richard, Alex and Meredith in&nbsp;Season 15&nbsp;due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;insurance fraud issue, although they eventually returned to&nbsp;work for her. She is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;keeping everyone in&nbsp;line.</p><p>Chandra Wilson, who was nominated for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>four</a> Emmys during her time on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Grey’s Anatomy</i></a>, has also starred in&nbsp;films such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Single Woman</i></a> (2008), <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Frankie &&nbsp;Alice</i></a> (2010), and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Christmas Harmony</i></a> (2018). Additionally, she made a&nbsp;guest appearance on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>General Hospital</i></a> in&nbsp;2019.</p><p><h2>3. Derek Shepherd</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b0/8be/5244315ac4a19189c6eaffc564.jpg><p><strong>Dr. McDreamy</strong>, also known as&nbsp;<strong>Derek Shepherd</strong>, was introduced in&nbsp;Season 1&nbsp;following a&nbsp;rumored <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>one-night affair</a> with Meredith Grey. Their courtship grew into a&nbsp;famous television romance. Tragically, Derek was engaged in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>horrific</a> automobile accident while assisting crash victims. The devastating episode highlighted his fight for adequate <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>medical</a> treatment, culminating in&nbsp;his heartbreaking death, a&nbsp;decision justified by&nbsp;creator <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Shonda Rhimes</a> in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;maintain the honesty of&nbsp;Meredith and Derek’s love.</p><p>Patrick Dempsey, the man behind McDreamy, expressed gratitude for Grey’s Anatomy but admitted there was a&nbsp;price to&nbsp;pay. Dempsey said that his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>departure</a> could have been delayed due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;desire for control over his schedule. Despite his departure, fans were excited to&nbsp;see McDreamy in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Season&nbsp;17</a>. Dempsey took on&nbsp;new projects such as&nbsp;the Italian series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Devils</i></a> and the Disney+ film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Disenchanted</i></a>, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;appearances in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Bridget Jones’s Baby</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ferrari</i></a>.</p><p>Since 1999, Patrick has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> to&nbsp;makeup artist Jillian Dempsey, with whom he&nbsp;shares three children: Talula, Darby, and Sullivan. His post-Grey’s journey included a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;film and television projects, ushering in&nbsp;a&nbsp;new chapter in&nbsp;his illustrious career. What many fans liked is&nbsp;the fact that McDreamy was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>named</a> the “Sexiest Man Alive” <a href=#>earlier</a> this year.</p><p><h2>4. Richard Webber</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a4/3ae/8034195159a6d6d6d9e4f9046e.jpg><p>Having worked with Meredith’s mother, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ellis Grey</a>, in&nbsp;the past, <strong>Richard Webber</strong>, the former Chief of&nbsp;Surgery, made his debut on&nbsp;the first episode of&nbsp;the show and recognized her brilliance right away. His character was portrayed by&nbsp;James Pickens Jr.</p><p>Despite his unwavering demeanor, Richard went through the same rollercoaster of&nbsp;struggles as&nbsp;the show’s characters. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lost</a> his wife and lost his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>job</a> due to&nbsp;insurance fraud with Meredith. Dr. Webber has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shifted</a> from being the Chief of&nbsp;Surgery to&nbsp;leading the hospital’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Residency Program</a>, a&nbsp;fitting role for a&nbsp;character who has mentored numerous others on&nbsp;the show.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;his dedication to&nbsp;<i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>, James Pickens&nbsp;Jr. graced other shows like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The X-Files</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Roseanne</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Yellowstone</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Conners</i></a>. He&nbsp;remained a&nbsp;consistent presence throughout <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> and its spin-offs. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> musician Gina Taylor in&nbsp;1984, and the two of&nbsp;them navigated life’s highs and lows on&nbsp;and off the screen with their two kids.</p><p><h2>5. Alex Karev</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b7/313/46fab15afd9f33a59aad095ae0.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the opening scene of&nbsp;the show, Justin Chambers played <strong>Alex Karev</strong>, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>arrogant</a> intern who foolishly thought Meredith was a&nbsp;nurse. He&nbsp;worked on&nbsp;his character for more than 15&nbsp;years, addressing his shortcomings until he&nbsp;said goodbye to&nbsp;his wife, friends, and career to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;Kansas and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reunite</a> with Izzie and their twins who were born from frozen embryos.</p><p>Departing in&nbsp;2020, Justin Chambers acknowledged the difficulty of&nbsp;bidding farewell to&nbsp;a&nbsp;pivotal period in&nbsp;his life, indicated his desire to&nbsp;investigate various acting jobs at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;fifty, and offered gratitude to&nbsp;his devoted wife and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>five</a> children. Expressing gratitude to&nbsp;the ABC family, Shonda Rimes, and the amazing cast and crew, he&nbsp;proceeded to&nbsp;play Marlon Brando in&nbsp;Paramount+’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Offer</i></a> in&nbsp;2022.</p><p><h2>6. Owen Hunt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f5/283/d2acab58a3b9cc22292413a1bd.jpg><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;talented surgeon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suffering</a> from PTSD following his time spent in&nbsp;Iraq, <strong>Owen Hunt</strong> made a&nbsp;big impression on&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy during Season&nbsp;5. As&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the series’ most enduring characters, Hunt’s journey through emotional relationships—including <a href=# title=marriages data-link=tag>marriages</a> to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cristina</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Amelia</a>—and, in&nbsp;the end, a&nbsp;long-term <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bond</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marriage</a> to&nbsp;Teddy Altman in&nbsp;Season 18&nbsp;were all seen by&nbsp;viewers.</p><p>Kevin McKidd experimented with several film projects after leaving Grey’s Anatomy, including <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Percy Jackson &&nbsp;the Olympians: The Lightning Thief</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Home Sweet Hell</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Tulip Fever</i></a>. In&nbsp;addition, he&nbsp;provided the voice of&nbsp;Fenn Rau in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Star Wars: Rebels</i></a> and animated characters in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Brave</i></a> and the ABC special <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Toy Story That Time Forgot</i></a>. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;his acting career, McKidd <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>directed</a> more than 30&nbsp;<i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> episodes.</p><p>McKidd went through a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;adjustments in&nbsp;his personal life. After an&nbsp;18-year marriage <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ended</a> in&nbsp;2017, he&nbsp;and his ex-wife, Jane Parker, have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>two</a> children, Iona and Joseph. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> Arielle Goldrath in&nbsp;2018, and they have a&nbsp;daughter named Nava and a&nbsp;son named Aiden. But only five months after McKidd announced their breakup on&nbsp;Instagram, Goldrath filed for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>divorce</a> in&nbsp;December 2022. In&nbsp;the midst of&nbsp;his career success, McKidd managed the difficulties of&nbsp;relationships and family life.</p><p><h2>7. Cristina Yang</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/314/b5b/5cc7165acaa06d23af2f16e4d6.jpg><p><strong>Cristina Yang</strong>, the determined and brilliant intern who shared an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>unbreakable</a> bond with Meredith, left Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Klausman Institute</a> for Medical Research in&nbsp;Switzerland after another round of&nbsp;hospital renaming. Her presence persisted through <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>letters</a>, emails, and phone calls, even though she was acknowledged in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>later episodes</a>. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Grey’s Anatomy cast, she surely contributed to&nbsp;the show’s popularity.</p><p>After leaving the show in&nbsp;2014, Sandra Oh&nbsp;told <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> that she would be&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;come back for the climax of&nbsp;the season if&nbsp;the plot worked out. After leaving Grey’s Anatomy, Oh&nbsp;maintained her popularity on&nbsp;television. She won a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>second Golden Globe</a> for her role in&nbsp;the BBC series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Killing Eve</i></a>, which was one of&nbsp;her highlights.</p><p>She has provided the voice of&nbsp;several animated movies, including <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Over the Moon</i></a> (2020), <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Raya and the Last Dragon</i></a> (2021), and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Turning Red</i></a> (2022), diversifying her repertoire across various roles since bidding adieu to&nbsp;the medical drama.</p><p><h2>8. George O’Malley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d2/97b/f9adc157d4b2c41b4f6a38a8a2.jpg><p><strong>George O’Malley</strong>, who gained the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nickname</a> “<strong>007</strong>” for his surgical accuracy and was well-known for being the first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>intern</a> to&nbsp;attempt an&nbsp;appendectomy, had a&nbsp;kind and energetic personality as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong bond with Meredith. His tragic death, in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>died</a> while saving a&nbsp;woman from a&nbsp;bus, had a&nbsp;profound effect on&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy fans.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2009 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with Entertainment Weekly, T.R. Knight—a 2007 Emmy nominee—left the show after five seasons, claiming issues with screen time, the plot of&nbsp;his character, and a&nbsp;breakdown in&nbsp;communication with Rhimes. Casting doubt on&nbsp;the details given about George’s arc, Knight made a&nbsp;surprising comeback in&nbsp;an&nbsp;episode airing in&nbsp;December 2020.</p><p>He&nbsp;performed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;TV series after Grey’s, including <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Good Wife</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>11.22.63</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Catch</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>When We&nbsp;Rise</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Genius: Einstein</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Genius: Picasso</i></a>. Knight also appeared in&nbsp;HBO Max’s first and second seasons of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Flight Attendant</i></a>. Beyond the drama of&nbsp;the hospital hallways, Knight has been blissfully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> to&nbsp;ballet dancer Patrick B. Leahy since 2013. They manage to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;healthy work-life balance.</p><p><h2>9. Izzie Stevens</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ea/f6d/c2249d51ca96032dc179161d4f.jpg><p>When she first started working on&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy, <strong>Izzie Stevens</strong> was a&nbsp;sweet intern who rose above her modest trailer park upbringing to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>become</a> a&nbsp;medical school model. Her kind disposition and passion for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>baking</a> contrasted sharply with Meredith and Cristina’s darker selves. Izzie went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tremendous extent for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>patient</a> Denny Duquette’s heart <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>transplant</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>struggled</a> with his passing during her turbulent plot.</p><p>Her struggles included a&nbsp;brief <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marriage</a> to&nbsp;Alex and romantic pursuits, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a&nbsp;brain tumor that caused her to&nbsp;experience <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hallucinations</a> of&nbsp;Denny’s spirit. After the hospital merger, her time at&nbsp;Seattle Grace came to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end, and Alex ultimately pushed for her to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>leave</a>. Izzie was mentioned as&nbsp;Alex’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reason</a> for leaving the hospital, even though she wasn’t visible after she left.</p><p>The changes in&nbsp;Katherine Heigl’s character’s journey were reflected in&nbsp;her exit from the show. Her relationship with the show’s creators was strained when she first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>withdrew</a> her nominations for an&nbsp;Emmy in&nbsp;2008, despite <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>winning</a> the previous year.

Leigh praised her five seasons of&nbsp;supporters for their constant support and expressed thanks for her experience.
