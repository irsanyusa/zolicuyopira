And in&nbsp;October of&nbsp;the very same year, they celebrated their wedding, which took place at&nbsp;a&nbsp;private ranch in&nbsp;California in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;about 100&nbsp;people. The day after the wedding, McDonald claimed on&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a> that his wedding day was the most amazing day of&nbsp;his life.

The wedding ceremony took place in&nbsp;October 2010, in&nbsp;northern India, and was attended only by&nbsp;the couple’s closest friends and relatives. They made sure that there wouldn’t be&nbsp;any interruptions and privacy was their number one priority at&nbsp;all times. They also made sure to&nbsp;take advantage of&nbsp;the region’s landscape and used it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;backdrop for such a&nbsp;great day.</p><p><h2>3.

Another 3&nbsp;months passed before the actual <a href=#>wedding</a> took place in&nbsp;Santa Susana, California. Unfortunately, in&nbsp;2015 Cuoco announced that she was filing for divorce. That was just <a href=#>21&nbsp;months</a> after they got engaged.</p><p><h2>5. Drew Barrymore and Jeremy Thomas: 1&nbsp;month</h2></p><p>They had barely met in&nbsp;1994 when this <a href=#>couple</a> decided to&nbsp;get married on&nbsp;March 20&nbsp;of&nbsp;the same year.

But life had other plans for him. In&nbsp;July 2013, he&nbsp;<a href=#>met</a> a&nbsp;lawyer named Amal Alamuddin, and after about 14&nbsp;months into their relationship, they tied the knot in&nbsp;a&nbsp;palazzo in&nbsp;Venice. The actor revealed that they met at&nbsp;his house when he&nbsp;had some friends over to&nbsp;visit. Of&nbsp;course, he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea that his future wife would be&nbsp;there.</p><p><h2>7.

That, and the fact that both were pretty famous, already turned their relationship into one of&nbsp;the most covered relationships by&nbsp;media back in&nbsp;the day.</p><p><h2>8.

She told the friend she was with that this was the man who would one day become her husband. Finally, in&nbsp;December 1984, her wishes came true. During an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a>, the actress revealed that as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;she saw his picture, she sent him her phone number, but he&nbsp;never called her back.
