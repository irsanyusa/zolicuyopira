But if you consider yourself a Housewives novice, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maybe you’ve always wanted to watch Housewives but were overwhelmed by the number of different series (and seasons) there are. Maybe you’re a fan of some of Bravo’s other shows and are ready for something new. Maybe you never really thought about it until you clicked on this guide. Whatever the reason, there’s no better time than now to start the most important <a href=#>reality TV</a> journey of your life. With an inimitable catalog of priceless memes, cutting one-liners, dramatic reveals and unforgettable reads, Housewives can be a surprisingly effective—and endlessly entertaining—way of taking your mind off everything.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While there are popular international iterations of Housewives, like Melbourne and Cheshire, this guide focuses on the 10 American series (past and present).

Of course, with the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Singer Stinger,”</a> it never is.

Over the course of 13 seasons, the ladies of Atlanta have routinely delivered top-notch drama, and quick, impeccable shade. Much of the show’s huge momentum (<a href=# rel=noopener>and unforgettable memes</a>) have been fueled by its all-star cast, most notably the inimitable NeNe Leakes, who left the show in 2015 and returned in 2017, before leaving a second time in 2020 when <a href=# rel=noopener>she accused host Andy Cohen of being racist and Bravo of not recognizing her creative contributions to the franchise</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current feud to watch:</strong> While the friction between Kenya Moore and Porsha Williams has been seasons-long, Season 13 has upped the ante for these two Atlanta housewives. Kenya’s diva antics and her relentless investigation into who might have slept with the stripper during a girls’ trip to South Carolina led to a fiery reignition of conflict with Porsha. That will be sure to dominate the rest of Season 13.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Most iconic meme: Although</strong> Nene has left the show again, her influence still reigns supreme on the Internet, where GIFs and memes abound of her shadiest one-liners and iconic facial responses. Chief among them is her protesting being brought into the drama at the Season 7 reunion (despite often helping to instigate it). “Now why am I in it?” Nene tells Andy and her cast mates amid a heated argument. “See how I always get thrown into stuff?”</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Real Housewives of New Jersey (RHONJ)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Real-Housewives-of-New-Jersey.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Series premiere:</strong> May 12, 2009</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current status:</strong> Season 11 airing</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current cast:</strong> Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Dolores Catania, Margaret Josephs, Jennifer Aydin, Jackie Goldschneider</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Notable past cast:</strong> Danielle Staub, Dina Manzo, Caroline Manzo</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Spinoffs: </strong><i>Manzo’d With Children</i>, <i>Teresa Checks In</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What to know: </strong>Within the cultural zeitgeist, the Garden State is subject to many a stereotype—and RHONJ indulges in them with gusto and delight. Case in point—when Teresa Giudice, the only current housewife remaining from the first season, flipped a table in an expletive-laden rage, it became more than just juicy fodder for the show, but instead a watershed moment in reality TV history. Themes of family abound with many cast members being related, but it’s not just familial strife that keeps the drama flowing in New Jersey—from Giudice serving time for mail, wire and bankruptcy fraud, to Margaret Josephs and her husband Joe tossing Danielle Staub’s husband Marty into the pool after a heated exchange, there’s no shortage of entertainment with RHONJ.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current feud to watch: </strong>Teresa Giudice and Jackie Goldschneider kicked off the Season 11 premiere, guns blazing, with an explosive fight triggered by a cheating rumor about Jackie’s husband and a comment about Teresa’s daughter Gia. With most of Season 11 to go, there’s no doubt that Teresa and Jackie’s feud will take center stage.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Most iconic meme: </strong>While it makes sense that Teresa’s notorious table-flipping moment might strike many as the ultimate meme for RHONJ, it’s Teresa’s daughter Gia who has emerged as the talent behind the reigning franchise meme. During Season 3 in 2011, a 10-year-old Gia tearfully sang an original sad song about the family feud between Teresa and Teresa’s brother, Joe Gorga. Flash forward a decade—Gia’s sad song has become a viral audio clip on TikTok, where it’s resonated with users reminiscing over embarrassing moments.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (RHOBH)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Real-Housewives-of-Beverly-Hills.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Series premiere:</b> Oct. 14, 2010</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Current status:</b> Season 11 premieres May 19</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Current cast:</b> Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, Dorit Kemsley, Erika Jayne, Garcelle Beauvais, Crystal Kung Minkoff, Sutton Stracke</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Notable past cast:</b> Lisa Vanderpump, Denise Richards, Brandi Glanville, Yolanda Hadid, Kim Richards, Camille Grammer, Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Spinoffs:</b> <i>Vanderpump Rules</i>, <i>Vanderpump Rules: Jax And Brittany Take Kentucky</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>What to know:</b> Known as the most glamorous <i>Housewives </i>city, <i>RHOBH </i>is all about glam squads, high fashion, extravagant homes and rubbing shoulders with Hollywood elites. But while they certainly know how to turn out a look, despite the Denise Richards-fueled high ratings of 2020, the ladies of Beverly Hills have recently been dogged by complaints of dull storylines, staged confrontations and superficiality. In the end, <i>Beverly Hills</i>’ greatest contribution to reality TV may be the long-running Lisa Vanderpump-led spinoff <i>Vanderpump Rules</i>, which centers on the young Los Angeles hopefuls who “work” at Vanderpump’s West Hollywood restaurant SUR—a.k.a. Sexy Unique Restaurant.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Current feud to watch:</b> If the Season 10 tension between Kyle Richards, the final <i>Beverly Hills </i>OG, and new fan-favorite Garcelle Beauvais doesn’t carry over into Season 11, there will almost certainly be some new drama between Erika Jayne and whoever tries to dig into the details of her recently announced divorce from husband Tom Girardi. A civil suit filed against the couple <a href=# rel=noopener>alleges</a> that the divorce is “simply a sham attempt to fraudulently protect Tom and Erika’s money from those that seek to collect on debts owed by Tom and his law firm GK”.

But a still from the scene of Taylor screaming and pointing while Kyle holds her back has since become one of the most enduring memes of the franchise. The screengrab took on a new life in recent years when an ingenious Twitter user combined it with the <a href=# rel=noopener>“confused cat at dinner”</a> meme to create the viral gem that is <a href=#>“woman yelling at a cat.”</a> Even Taylor herself seemed to find it funny, tagging Camille in response to a joking comment about someone dressing up as the meme for Halloween.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Real Housewives of Potomac (RHOP)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Real-Housewives-of-Potomac.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Series premiere:</strong> Jan. 17, 2016</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current status:</strong> Season 6 filming</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current cast:</strong> Gizelle Bryant, Ashley Darby, Robyn Dixon, Karen Huger, Candiace Dillard, Wendy Osefo</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Notable past cast:</strong> Monique Samuels, Charrisse Jackson Jordan, Katie Rost</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What to know: </strong>A sleepy, etiquette-obsessed suburb of D.C. might not seem like the most likely environment for a Housewives series. However, Potomac has emerged as one of the best and most beloved franchises, thanks entirely to the sparkling personalities of its stars and the show’s willingness to dive into deeper, more complex storylines that explore race, class and sexuality. While in recent seasons, sexual harassment allegations against Ashley Darby’s husband Michael have given the show its most sobering moments, it’s during the heavier moments that Potomac often shines. It balances all-too-real scenarios with humor, shade and fun, and a cast of truly over-the-top characters ranging from “the Green-Eyed Bandits” Gizelle Bryant and Robyn Dixon to “the Grand Dame,” Karen Huger.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current feud to watch: </strong>It’s undeniable that the epic Season 5 blowout between Monique Samuels and Candiace Dillard has become the stuff of not only RHOP, but Housewives legend, thanks to the epic winery fight that turned physical. However, real fans know the real beef to watch is between OGs Karen Huger and Gizelle Bryant, who are perpetually vying for the top spot in the Potomac hierarchy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Most iconic meme: </strong>While Gizelle and Karen have plenty of shady one-liners delivered with plenty of side-eye, it’s Robyn Dixon who gave the franchise one of the most beloved memes with a quip that she said in exasperation during the Season 5 reunion. After a heated exchange with Monique’s husband Chris ensues during the reunion, Dixon, who attended solo, tells the women, “I am so glad that Juan Dixon is not here right now!” The statement in both its sincerity and absurdity, resonated with the Internet, who wasted no time in making it go viral.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Real Housewives of Dallas (RHOD)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Real-Housewives-of-Dallas.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Series premiere:</strong> April 11, 2016</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current status:</strong> Season 5 airing now</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current cast: </strong>Stephanie Hollman, Brandi Redmond, D’Andra Simmons, Kameron Westcott, Kary Brittingham, Tiffany Moon</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Notable past cast:</strong> LeeAnne Locken, Cary Deuber</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What to know: </strong>Everything’s bigger in Texas—except maybe the Housewives drama. Suffering in recent years from a lack of the unforgettable moments that are the bread and butter of cities like Potomac, New York and Atlanta, Dallas has <a href=# rel=noopener>consistently been plagued by low ratings</a>. With wildcard OG LeeAnne Locken—known for <a href=# rel=noopener>smashing glasses</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>threatening her castmates with physical violence</a>—exiting the show in the wake of <a href=# rel=noopener>racist comments she made about co-star Kary Brittingham</a>, Season 5 marked the dawn of a new era for the ladies of the Lone Star State. Locken was replaced by anesthesiologist Dr. Tiffany Moon, the first Asian American housewife, who quickly became a fan-favorite after confronting Brandi Redmond about a <a href=# rel=noopener>racist video she posted on her Instagram story mocking Asians</a>. But only time will tell if Dallas will live to see another renewal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current feud to watch:</strong> Brandi continues to dig herself into a hole over the backlash she received for her racist Instagram video, recently telling Tiffany that she feels like she can’t be “completely, authentically herself” in front of her. Of course, <a href=# rel=noopener>Tiffany herself put it best</a> in a subsequent confessional: “If she sees me and it reminds her of her video and all the negativity that she got from it, that’s not my problem. I cannot change that I am Asian. If that makes you uncomfortable, that’s your problem.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Most iconic meme:</strong> In typical Housewives fashion, the Dallas ladies’ Season 3 trip to Copenhagen spiraled out of control virtually upon arrival when Kameron Westcott and D’Andra Simmons sparred over Kameron’s mother-in-law warning D’Andra against hanging out with Brandi. But it wasn’t until LeeAnne got involved that the fight nearly came to blows. Luckily, LeeAnne had the sense to remove herself from the situation before letting loose on D’Andra with a rant that immediately earned a spot in the annals of Housewives meme history: “I’m exhausted. My weave is exhausted. The pantyliner on my underwear is exhausted.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>E X H A U S T E D !!!!! 🤣🤣🤣😘😘❤️❤️ <a href=#>#RHOD</a></p>— LeeAnne Locken (@LeeAnneLocken) <a href=#>June 28, 2018</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City (RHOSLC)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Real-Housewives-of-Salt-Lake-City.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Series premiere:</strong> Nov. 11, 2020</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current status:</strong> Season 2 filming</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current c</strong><strong>ast:</strong> Jen Shah, Heather Gay, Whitney Rose, Meredith Marks, Lisa Barlow, Mary Cosby</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Wh</strong><strong>at to know:</strong> RHOSLC may have just wrapped its first season, but make no mistake—these housewives are hardly novices when it comes to bringing the drama. Mixing in a heady dose of religion and some complex racial politics with the longtime Housewives formula makes for an outstanding inaugural season, which is also bolstered by storylines so over-the-top, you have to see it to believe it. What other franchise can boast a Pentecostal pastor married to her step-grandfather, a pole-dancing ex-Mormon, a Mormon tequila entrepreneur and a Mormon-turned-Muslim with seven assistants, but no clear job? The ante will be upped next season as well, as <a href=# rel=noopener>Shah was arrested while filming Season 2</a> after being accused of taking part in a fraudulent telemarketing scheme. Shah has pleaded not guilty to fraud and money laundering charges.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Current feud to watch: </strong>While Jen Shah’s vocal outbursts about Mary Cosby’s claim that she “smelled like hospital” made for a strong contender for best feud of the series, fan favorite Heather Gay’s aggressive and sustained attacks against Lisa Barlow’s cool relationship to her hint that there’s much more drama coming our way next season.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Most iconic meme: </strong>While there were no shortages of dramatic moments from the inaugural season of RHOSLC, Meredith’s tight-lipped response of “I’m disengaging” during bouts of conflict instantly became a fan favorite, especially when delivered in her monotone drawl.

The cancellation wasn’t for lack of buzz, either—ahead of its premiere, the show was already garnering notoriety after Michaele Salah and her husband crashed a state dinner, where <a href=# rel=noopener>they were photographed speaking to President Barack Obama</a> (some have pointed to this controversy as part of why the show was cancelled). The show also broke form with other Housewives series, with a more serious tone and a focus on the characters’ jobs and philanthropy in the nation’s capitol, as opposed to dramatic fights or petty asides.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Real Housewives of Miami (RHOM)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Real-Housewives-of-Miami.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Series premiere:</strong> Feb. 22, 2011</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Series fin</strong><strong>ale:</strong> Nov. 4, 2013</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Number of seasons:</strong> 3</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Cast: </strong>Lea Black, Alexia Echevarria, Adriana de Moura, Marysol Patton, Larsa Pippen, Cristy Rice, Lisa Hochstein, Joanna Krupa, Ana Quincoces, Karent Sierra</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What to know: </strong>Eight years after it went off the air, RHOM is <a href=# rel=noopener>reportedly</a> coming back for a fourth season and, as of February 2020, “already in the full swing of interviewing potential cast mates to hire.” Although Miami was never officially canceled, according to Andy Cohen, low ratings, specifically for the Season 3 reunion, were to blame for its discontinuation.
