She‚Äôs desperately looking for answers as&nbsp;she feels overwhelmed and too emotionally invested to&nbsp;think rationally. She wrote&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter describing the issue, ‚ÄúDear <strong>Bright Side</strong>, I&nbsp;am writing to&nbsp;you to&nbsp;share my&nbsp;problem in&nbsp;hopes that your readers might be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;direct me&nbsp;to&nbsp;the right path. I&nbsp;also aim to&nbsp;warn other women to&nbsp;be&nbsp;careful, who might be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the same situation as&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;wouldn‚Äôt wish my&nbsp;luck on&nbsp;my&nbsp;worst enemies...‚Äù</p><p>She reveals that initially, her <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> life was picture-perfect, ‚ÄúI&nbsp;met David (30) when we&nbsp;were both in&nbsp;<a href=# title=college data-link=tag>college</a>. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;him ever since&nbsp;I saw him and to&nbsp;my&nbsp;surprise, he&nbsp;felt the same way. We‚Äôve been together ever since. About 6&nbsp;years ago, we&nbsp;mutually decided we&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.‚Äù</p><p><h2>She learned the hard way she couldn‚Äôt have kids.</h2></p><p>When after years of trying the couple couldn't get pregnant, they sought medical advice, "We tried for years but nothing. I felt so depressed and scared. David suggested we go see a doctor, so we did.</p><p>The doctor ran some tests, and I was told I couldn't have children. My whole world came crashing down. I remember I would cry so often and at random times that at one point I thought I was going crazy."</p><p><h2>The couple decided to&nbsp;opt for surrogacy.</h2></p><p>"My husband would try to console me and divert my mind. He suggested adoption, but I wanted my own child. One day it hit me. I'm infertile, but I always wanted to be a mom, and surrogacy may be the best available option for me. I spoke to David, and he agreed at first, but later hesitated upon learning how expensive the procedure is.</p><p>We were indeed financially struggling at the time, and I wasn't able to work properly due to my failing mental health. I shared the problem with my parents and other close loved ones, including my cousin Amy. To my surprise, Amy offered to be our surrogate to cut costs, and I couldn't have been more grateful to her then," Martha adds.</p><p><h2>After multiple struggles, the couple was gifted with a&nbsp;boy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ffc/ea9/c17abd559eb85a44ea778433eb.jpg><p>Martha reveals what happened next, "After some failed IVF attempts, she finally became pregnant! 3 years ago, my husband and I had our son by surrogacy, and he was the most perfect boy! I was over the moon. We named him George and I spent all my time taking care of him.</p><p>Amy would also come over often to see George. She even babysat for him while I had to take urgent trips for work, and David suggested we call her for help. I thought nothing of his suggestion back then, but maybe I should have."</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;shocking revelation that tore the family apart.</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;few days back, George fell sick and was due for some tests at&nbsp;the hospital. Martha took her son to&nbsp;the doctor and the blood report left her baffled. ‚ÄúRecently, I&nbsp;took our son to&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was feeling sick. They ran some blood work and&nbsp;I found out I‚Äôm not his biological mom. I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;error and told my&nbsp;husband we&nbsp;should sue the fertility clinic, but to&nbsp;my&nbsp;horror, my&nbsp;husband confessed that it&nbsp;was not their fault.</p><p>He&nbsp;admitted that he&nbsp;got close to&nbsp;my&nbsp;cousin around the time we&nbsp;were going through the IVF process and slept with her a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times. I&nbsp;felt so&nbsp;enraged and <a href=#>betrayed</a>, that&nbsp;I can‚Äôt put my&nbsp;disappointment into words. The son I‚Äôve loved more than my&nbsp;life is&nbsp;not even mine but a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband‚Äôs affair with my&nbsp;cousin...I immediately asked David to&nbsp;leave the house! I&nbsp;couldn‚Äôt bear to&nbsp;even look at&nbsp;him!‚Äù</p><p><h2>Martha is&nbsp;filing for divorce but she‚Äôs not sure how to&nbsp;deal with George.</h2></p><p>"I'm already talking to my lawyer regarding a <a href=#>divorce</a>, and I told my family about the issue. They are supportive of me and are saying they'll agree with whatever I choose to do. David keeps trying to contact me, but I don't want to give him another chance after all that happened. Amy bawled her eyes out and cried to me asking for forgiveness, but I don't think I can ever forgive her.</p><p>As for George, I am torn. I do love him still, but I have to admit that every time I look at him, I'm reminded of my husband's affair, and it makes me sick. What should I do?" Martha writes seeking advice.</p><p>Thank you for writing to&nbsp;us, Martha! We&nbsp;are sorry that you had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through such a&nbsp;terrible and difficult situation. In&nbsp;such a&nbsp;troubled time, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;surround yourself with people who love you and remember time will heal your wounds. Here are some steps you might consider taking:</p><p><strong>Seek Emotional Support</strong>: It‚Äôs crucial to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;support system. Talking to&nbsp;a&nbsp;trusted friend, family member, or&nbsp;therapist can help process the emotions and provide a&nbsp;safe space to&nbsp;express feelings.</p><p><strong>Legal Advice</strong>: Consulting with a&nbsp;family lawyer can help you understand the rights and options regarding custody of&nbsp;George and any potential legal actions against the fertility clinic or&nbsp;the individuals involved.</p><p><strong>Couples Counseling</strong>: If&nbsp;you wish to&nbsp;explore the possibility of&nbsp;repairing the relationship, couples counseling can provide a&nbsp;structured environment to&nbsp;address the issues and work through the betrayal.</p><p><strong>Self-Care</strong>: Taking time for self-care is&nbsp;essential. Engaging in&nbsp;activities that bring joy and relaxation can help manage stress and emotional pain.</p><p><strong>Consider Future Steps</strong>: Reflecting on&nbsp;what you want for the future, whether it‚Äôs co-parenting, or&nbsp;moving on&nbsp;independently, is&nbsp;important. Making a&nbsp;plan can provide a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;direction and control.</p><p><strong>Support Groups</strong>: Joining support groups for individuals who have experienced similar situations can provide a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;community and understanding.</p><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;deeply personal journey, and there‚Äôs no&nbsp;right or&nbsp;wrong way to&nbsp;navigate&nbsp;it. It‚Äôs important to&nbsp;prioritize your well-being and make decisions that align with your values and needs.</p><p>Another woman shared her tragic story and what led her to&nbsp;divorce her husband.
