The purpose was partly to photograph troop movements, partly to demonstrate U.S. resolve to stand firm in the Red-threatened little kingdom. But last week, after Communist gunners shot down two American planes in two days, the U.S. decided that shooting back with cameras was not enough—and in a small way Southeast Asia’s crisis began to “escalate.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hitting the Road. The recon sweeps were made by Navy jets from the U.S. 7th Fleet aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, lying off South Viet Nam in the South China Sea. Prime target for the planes high-speed, still-photo lenses was Route 7, a ribbon of dirt snaking out of Communist North Viet Nam into Laos. Known by Laotians as Thang Nay, or the Big Road, Route 7 has long been used by North Viet Nam’s Reds to truck men and guns to the Pathet Lao (up to 400 vehicles a day), in open violation of Laos’ neutrality accords. To get closeups of the latest influx, the supersonic reconnaissance craft flat-hatted in at virtually treetop level, at slowpoke speeds of perhaps 450 m.p.h., and often from the same predictable angles.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Communists fired on the jets from the start, and with practice soon found the range. One day at noon, while maneuvering his RF-8A over the vicinity of Ban Ban, a collection of 300 thatch-roofed huts on Route 7, Navy Lieut. Charles F. Klusmann, 30, of San Diego felt ground fire thumping through his craft, ejected himself seconds before the plane tumbled to earth. An American search helicopter out of Vientiane spotted the downed pilot at the edge of a clearing, but it was driven off by Communist fire that wounded the chopper’s copilot. The Pathet Lao radio later announced that Klusmann had been taken prisoner.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Punitive Punch. For the first time, Washington then ordered armed jet fighters to escort the recons, but disaster nearly repeated itself. Again over Ban Ban, a Navy F-8A Crusader escort, flown by Commander Doyle W. Lynn, 37, of La Mesa, Calif., was shot down by the Reds. Lynn likewise bailed out, but after a harrowing night in the tiger-inhabited jungle, he was rescued by a U.S. helicopter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Back in the Pentagon, flustered brass described the Red gunners as lucky, hastened to explain that jets are terribly vulnerable anyway. “Hell,” said one Navy man, “a kid standing at the end of the runway with a baseball bat can knock down a jet if he gets the ball into those turbine blades.” But the Reds weren’t using baseballs. Western military experts guessed that the U.S. planes had been hit by Soviet-designed ZPU2s—twin, 14.5 mm., heavy machine guns mounted on an armored car and operated from a fast-turning swivel seat. U.S. officials suspected that the guns were operated by North Vietnamese crews, but the Laotian Reds may well have been trained to operate them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Washington, the Administration decided on a little more escalation. From a base in the Philippines, eight F-100 U.S. Air Force jet fighter-bombers took off, headed over the northern sector of South Viet Nam, then veered up the Laotian corridor. Their mission: to deliver a punitive punch to the harassing antiaircraft guns.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Power Demonstration. The attackers’ arrival around breakfast time, shortly after sunrise, must have come as a distinct surprise to the Communist gunners. Instead of taking evasive action, as the reconnaissance craft had always done, these jets bore down, dropped rockets and bombs, then whisked away. Behind, they left a Communist antiaircraft emplacement demolished in smoking ruins.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The demonstration of U.S. power brought shocked outcries from the Communists. Red Chinese Premier Chou En-lai warned that “Laos is a close neighbor of China.” Declared Jenmin Jih Pao, Peking’s Communist Party organ: “The United States will meet with an even more powerful rebuff.” In Vientiane, Neutralist Premier Prince Souvanna Phouma, who had requested the reconnaissance flights originally, claimed that he had not asked for armed jet escorts, called for a “temporary suspension” of all overflights. The U.S. went along for the moment but announced that it had a “clear understanding” with Souvanna that the flights would be resumed whenever necessary. After a session with the U.S. ambassador (see following story), Souvanna agreed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At week’s end the flights were again under way after Souvanna Phouma reported “important movements of Pathet Lao and Viet Minh troops.” The Neutralist Premier told a press conference that the aerial reconnaissance had produced some “interesting photos” proving the presence of North Vietnamese troops in Laos. One photograph shows a Communist truck convoy entering Laos only a short distance from the North Viet Nam border.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Call for Aid. The government, meanwhile, scored a blow of its own. According to Pathet Lao broadcasts, six U.S.-supplied, converted trainer planes of the Laotian air force bombed and strafed the Pathet Lao headquarters village of Khang Khay, destroying the offices of Pathet Lao Chief Prince Sou-phanouvong and Red China’s “economic and cultural mission,” killing one Chinese and injuring five. It was the first time that the Chinese Reds had admitted having a delegation with the Pathet Lao.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the Laotian ground war, the Communists renewed their pressure on Neutralist positions west of the Plain of Jars. Under the command of game little General Kong Le, the Neutralists fought back as best they could. From his ramshackle, mountainside headquarters southwest of the Plain, Kong Le directs an army reduced to some 3,000 troops, but has been reinforced by thousands of anti-Communist Meo tribesmen who have fled Pathet Lao areas. Last week, during a visit to Vientiane, Kong appealed to the nations of the non-Communist world to help Laos remain neutral, urged the U.S. “to help us more and send more jet bombers and fighters to destroy all enemy positions.” Not that Souvanna’s coalition government is requesting such aid. “We have asked the Premier many times for foreign troops,” said Kong Le, “but there was no answer.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vaXBnboFwuMCoqmado5iura3ToqanZZmjerW0xGaYoqpf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./services-publics-locaux-les-modalites-du-soutien-de-letat-pour-2021.html>&#171;&nbsp;les modalits du soutien de l'tat pour 2021</a>
