class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The FIFA Women’s World Cup has reached the semifinals amid a wave of momentum for women’s sports in the United States. Greater financial investment, increased viewership and more sponsorship dollars have flooded the women’s game over the past few years, most notably in the past 18 months.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Women’s pro sports leagues like the WNBA and NWSL have made the most headway. The WNBA, which <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>raised</a> $75 million in capital as part of its first-ever funding round a year ago, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>aired</a> its most-watched All-Star Game ever last month. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>said</a> the league could expand from 12 to 14 teams in 2025 as it considers about a half-dozen cities including Philadelphia and Toronto.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Meanwhile, the NWSL <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>awarded an expansion team</a> in April to an ownership group in San Francisco, led by investment firm Sixth Street, for a record $53 million fee. In 2024, the Kansas City Current will open the first stadium built specifically for a women’s pro sports team after devoting nearly $120 million toward the project. Commissioner Jessica Berman <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>said</a> in May that the league could add two more teams by 2026.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Amid this greater interest and financial investment, new Morning Consult research finds that roughly 25% of U.S. adults are women’s sports fans, defined as those who watch, read about or seek information about women’s sports at least monthly. Of that group, more than 3 in 5 are men, almost half identify as white and a plurality are millennials.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But despite increased momentum, pessimism for the future of women’s sports is high, especially among older adults. A majority of U.S. adults (55%) said that women’s sports will always be less popular than men’s sports. Furthermore, around half of the 16 most popular women’s sports icons are retired or close to retiring, suggesting that many women’s leagues could have trouble maintaining a connection with existing fans and winning over new ones.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Women’s soccer is in the spotlight right now, but other sports garner more support</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Currently, all eyes are on soccer. The first three World Cup matches for the U.S. women’s national team <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>averaged</a> 4.35 million viewers, marking the most-watched group stage ever on English-language TV.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Still, interest in women’s soccer in the United States isn’t as pronounced as some may think. Morning Consult’s July data shows that 28% of U.S. adults said they enjoy watching it either “a lot” or “somewhat,” ranking seventh among the 15 women’s sports included in our survey.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Volleyball, skiing, basketball and tennis are the top women’s sports that U.S. adults most enjoy watching. In the United States, volleyball’s steady growth recently <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>hit</a> a high school participation boom, making it the country’s second most popular sport among girls in 2022. The success of the U.S. women’s indoor volleyball team at the recent Tokyo Olympics, where they captured gold for the first time ever, may also have contributed to the sport’s rise in popularity. Softball — which has experienced <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>record-setting viewership growth</a> in recent years with the Women’s College World Series — and tennis are also popular women’s sports in America.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Among the four leagues and associations tested, 17% of U.S. adults said they watch the WNBA at least monthly, making it the most popular women’s league, while 14% said the same of the NWSL and WTA. Given the WNBA’s longevity and close affiliation with the NBA, it’s no surprise that the league is No. 1 domestically.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Serena and Venus Williams top the list of most popular women athletes</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While basketball may have a slight edge among the major U.S. sports, there’s still room for all women’s sports to grow when it comes to player popularity. Around half of the 16 most popular women athletes in the United States are either retired or nearing retirement, meaning their affiliated leagues and associations could struggle with public awareness in the near future.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">About 3 in 5 U.S. adults (59%) said they have a favorable opinion of recently retired tennis star and 23-time Grand Slam singles champion Serena Williams, making her the most popular female athlete, followed by her sister Venus (53%).</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But some of the best women athletes in the United States remain unrecognizable. More than 3 in 5 U.S. adults (64%) said they’ve never heard of Las Vegas Aces forward and last year’s WNBA MVP A’ja Wilson, while LSU’s Angel Reese and Iowa’s Caitlin Clark — two of the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>breakout stars</a> from the most recent women’s college basketball tournament — are similarly unknown.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This could be partially due to the fact that only 5% of all U.S. sports coverage focuses on women’s sports, per a 2021 <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>academic study</a> by the University of Southern California and Purdue University. Meanwhile, almost one-third of U.S. adults (32%) said women’s sports would become more popular in America if sports media covered more women’s games.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">To prepare athletes for their futures on and off the court, schools, starting at the high school level, should consider educating their players about how to market themselves on social media and in public. Relying solely on media exposure from traditional networks and digital streaming services is no longer an option.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Then when these athletes enter college, they may already have a small but devoted online audience, which can in turn be amplified by their university’s athletic department as it aims to showcase their student-athletes’ personalities, with the end goal of driving increased viewership.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Most U.S. adults don’t see a future where women’s sports are as popular as men’s</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Majorities of every generation except Gen Z believe that women’s sports will always be less popular than men’s sports, which doesn’t bode well for the fandom.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It will take broader cultural changes to move the needle, as well as time and investment from the leagues themselves. Whether the solution to boosting popularity lies in broadcasting more women’s games live on cable TV, as many respondents suggested, or creating more women-specific media brands (think espnW, Just Women’s Sports and The GIST), one thing is certain: The sports industry needs more stars to elevate the profile of women’s sports.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But it’s not all bad news. Women’s sports <i>are</i> seeing signs of growth. This year’s women’s college basketball national championship between LSU and Iowa — featuring a marquee matchup between Reese and Clark — <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>averaged</a> nearly 10 million viewers on ABC and ESPN2,&nbsp; becoming the most-watched title game in tournament history. And in early August, the Women’s World Cup <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>set a new attendance record</a> with the round of 16 drawing over 1.36 million fans, surpassing the prior mark of about 1.35 million for the 2015 tournament.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6K8tMCMqaaprZyWv27Dzqacp6tdqL2wvtOsZJqsmKGytbHSZqys</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-stranger-veena-sud-quibi-series-film-hulu-1235956728.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Strangers Unlikely Second Act: How Veena Sud Turned Her Quibi Series Into a Featu</a>
